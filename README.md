👋 Hello, World! I'm iced-lemontea
Welcome to my GitHub playground! 🚀 Here, you'll find a mix of projects, experiments, and maybe even a few unfinished ideas (because who doesn’t love a good work in progress?).

🔥 About Me
💻 Code Enthusiast – I love building things that solve problems or just look cool.

🌱 Forever Learning – Currently diving deep into art website development.

🎯 Goal – To write code that doesn’t just work but also makes someone smile. 😄

☕ Fueled By – Coffee, music, and the occasional existential crisis about semicolons.
